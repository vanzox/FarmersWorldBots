And then separately enter the following commands (clicking Enter in between each one):
```
pip install selenium
pip install selenium-wire
pip install packaging
```
if pip install didn't work, then try to install all of the above modules like this:
```
py -m pip install selenium
```
(use it for all of the other modules above, by just swapping them in for "selenium")

If it still doesn't work, then you will have to reinstall pip using the following command:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
and then running the first three commands that were stated above

If you are running the bot on a virtual machine, don't forget to install "visual studio 2015(or older)"
It can be found right here:

After you have set up everything stated above, go to the folder where the bot file is stored and right click on the file that you want to use. Click on "Edit with IDLE" to open the file of the bot.

Then just click on "Run", and then "Run Module" (or just click F5 on your keyboard) and the bot will start working. It will automatically open up the farmersworld game website, and click the login buttons, and you will have 2 minutes to enter your account detail, and click the login button, after which the bot will start automatically endlessly working, as long as you have the needed items in your inventory (e.g. barley seeds, corn seeds, fishing rod, etc.)
